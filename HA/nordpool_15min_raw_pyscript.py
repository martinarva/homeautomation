# ## THIS SCRIPT IS DEPRECATED AND NO LONGER MAINTAINED ##

**A new, improved, and more flexible version of this script is now available.**

The new script includes all the functionality of this old one and adds many improvements for stability and performance. You can easily configure it to provide **only the raw price sensor** by disabling the optional import and export sensors.

Please upgrade to the new version here:
